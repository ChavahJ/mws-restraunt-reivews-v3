# Build Boilerplate Static ES6 SASS

A boilerplate for building a static app/website with ES6 and SASS.

This project was created to enable the easy, setup-free use of ES6 and SASS while creating a static website/app.

## Features

- Dev-server to aid development by automatically refreshing the browser whenever an edit is made to any of the source files.
- Build script that:
  - Minifies, concatenates, and bundles all JavaScript, SASS, and CSS files.
  - Converts all ES6 to browser friendly ES5.
  - Parses SASS/CSS files and adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules.
